# Release Automation

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

The repository now has **fully automated release management** using release-please.

### How It Works

1. **Make commits** using conventional commit format:

   - `feat: description` → Minor version bump (new features)
   - `fix: description` → Patch version bump (bug fixes)
   - `chore: description` → No version bump (maintenance)
   - `docs: description` → No version bump (documentation)

2. **Push to main** → GitHub Action automatically runs

3. **Release PR created** → Contains version bump and changelog

4. **Merge PR** → Creates GitHub release and git tag automatically

### Current State

- **Version**: v0.6.0
- **Next release**: Will be v0.6.1 when you add a `feat:` or `fix:` commit
- **Configuration**:
  - `.release-please-manifest.json` → Tracks current version
  - `release-please-config.json` → Configuration
  - `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` → GitHub Action

### What Was Fixed

- ✅ Correct version progression (no more v0.7.0 with old commits)
- ✅ Clean git history tracking from v0.6.0 baseline
- ✅ Automated PR creation and release generation
- ✅ Proper semantic versioning
- ✅ GitHub Actions with Personal Access Token for enterprise

### Usage

Just develop normally with conventional commits:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new banking feature"
git push origin main
```

The automation handles the rest!

**Migration completed**: From manual `npm version patch` → Fully automated release-please workflow
